Voice Guide: Kevin Today (mieubrisse)
======================================
Based on analysis of 30 Substack posts spanning personal development, leverage/decisionmaking, AI explainers, tech tools, relationship advice, and biographical analysis.

Voice Summary
-------------
Kevin writes like an engineer who discovered philosophy at a music festival and can't stop telling you about both. His prose is kinetic and irreverent -- he'll invoke Archimedes and Cthulhu's asshole in the same post, explain brain chemistry through the metaphor of a shaken snowglobe, and make you laugh at a rap song's terrible life advice before pivoting to a genuine lesson about karma. He writes with the directness of someone who's been through startup burnout, therapy, and insomnia, and has emerged with a compulsive need to systematize what he's learned and share it.

His voice occupies a distinctive space: casual enough to drop strategic profanity and pop culture references, but substantive enough to cite scientific studies and build multi-post argument chains. He treats the reader as an intelligent peer -- someone who's high-performing but might be sabotaging themselves in ways they don't see. The overall effect is a smart friend who's two steps ahead on the same path, leaning across the table saying, "Dude, you've got to hear about this thing I figured out." He never preaches; he shares what he's done, what worked, and invites you to try it.

The writing favors concrete examples over abstraction, personal stories over hypotheticals, and action over theory. Every concept gets anchored in Kevin's own life -- his lost wallet, his broken glass, his sleep struggles, his girlfriend fights -- and then expanded outward to a principle the reader can apply. The result is writing that feels simultaneously personal and useful.

Defining Characteristics
------------------------
1. **Strategic profanity as emphasis device.** Profanity appears sparingly but always in service of emphasis or humor, often capitalized for extra impact ("Fucking Leveraged", "Fucking Tough"). This signals irreverence and establishes anti-corporate, anti-pretension credibility.

2. **Personal-story-to-principle arc.** Nearly every post opens with a concrete personal experience (broken glass, lost wallet, gym playlist, dating fight) and expands it into a transferable principle. The story does the persuading; the principle is just the label.

3. **Interconnected idea web.** Posts heavily cross-reference each other, building a growing conceptual universe. Key concepts like "negative leverage," "exobrain," "Four Horsemen of Bad Decisionmaking," and "unique work" become recurring vocabulary across posts, creating the feeling of a coherent worldview.

4. **Recurring thinker pantheon.** A small set of intellectual heroes -- Naval Ravikant, Nassim Taleb, Charlie Munger, Ben Franklin, Shane Parrish -- are referenced repeatedly as authorities. These figures function as a shared vocabulary with the reader and as "board of directors" for the author's thinking.

5. **Absurdist humor in service of serious points.** Jokes are never ornamental. The humor -- from image captions to parenthetical asides to extended absurd metaphors ("District 9'd your toilet") -- is always in service of making a concept sticky or deflating pretension around a serious topic.

6. **Direct reader interrogation.** Posts consistently close sections or end with direct questions to the reader: "Are you resting enough to maximize your productivity?" "Are you building an honor asset?" These aren't rhetorical flourishes; they're genuine invitations to self-reflect.

7. **Short, punchy paragraph structure.** Paragraphs are overwhelmingly 1-3 sentences. Single-sentence paragraphs appear at emotional peaks or for emphasis. The visual rhythm on the page is open and airy, never dense.

8. **Callout boxes with emoji labels.** Distinctive use of blockquote-style callouts prefixed with emoji to signal information type: `> ⚠️` for warnings, `> 💡` for tips, `> ℹ️` for context, `> 🤔` for food-for-thought, `> 💭` for the author's personal speculation.

9. **Systems thinking applied to personal life.** The author consistently frames personal problems as system failures rather than character flaws, then designs solutions using engineering concepts (idempotency, pipelines, DRY, Five Whys). Personal development is treated as infrastructure engineering.

10. **Italics for emphasis on single key words.** Rather than bolding for emphasis mid-sentence, the author uses italics on individual words to create vocal stress: "they're even more powerful than _I realized_", "so they _can't_ be touched", "it was _never_ about the code".

Sentence-Level Patterns
------------------------

**Sentence length and rhythm**

Kevin favors short-to-medium sentences (8-20 words), punctuated by very short declarative statements (2-6 words) for emphasis. The rhythm builds through a few expository sentences and then lands a short one:

> "I'd assumed all the glass pieces would be visible. The size of a pen tip, at smallest. But what I swept up was glass dust."

> "The startup world is strewn with the bones of failed companies. The music industry is full of never-famous nobodies."

> "GPT-2 shocked the world with how human-like its output was. For the first time, humans began doubting whether its poems were authored by man or machine."

Fragment sentences appear frequently for dramatic punctuation:

> "Scary stuff."

> "Exponential explosion."

> "It's that."

> "Painting, not surgery."

> "Be Rembrandt."

**Sentence structure**

Sentences are predominantly simple or compound. Complex sentences with multiple subordinate clauses are rare. Kevin front-loads the point and adds qualification afterward, rather than building through conditions to a conclusion:

> "But stress straps reality-distortion goggles to our minds."

> "The ambiguity is a speed feature, not a bug."

He frequently starts sentences with "But", "And", "So", "Meaning,", and "Yet" -- treating conjunctions as sentence starters for conversational flow:

> "But just because a small amount of work _can_ trigger widespread results doesn't guarantee it will."

> "And now LLMs let the machine do the same."

> "Meaning, only those who warped their brains to think in definite, precise ways were good at computers."

**Punctuation habits**

- **Em dashes:** Used for mid-sentence asides, but not excessively (1-3 per post): "no Revolutionary War. But even without the 'winning a war and starting a country' bits, the guy was a baller."
- **Parentheses:** Used for clarifications, asides, and humor: "(David Goggins swings out of the ceiling)", "(Think how many thousands of deaths that is!)", "(not a 🤓)"
- **Italics:** Heavy use for emphasis on key words, image captions, and notes to the reader.
- **Bold:** Reserved for key terms, defined concepts, and headers within sections.
- **Ellipses:** Used sparingly, primarily in callout boxes or for trailing-off effect: "...it's registered with this Japanese domain registrar, but the registrant is hidden. Boo."
- **Colons:** Frequently used to set up lists or examples.
- **Numbered lists:** Always use `1.` for every item (relying on Markdown auto-numbering).

Vocabulary and Diction
----------------------

**Word choice tendencies**

The vocabulary lives in a specific register: intelligent-casual. Technical terms from engineering (idempotency, pipeline, DRY, OAuth), psychology (fight-or-flight, System 1/System 2, circadian clock), and philosophy (via negativa, steelman) appear frequently but are always explained or linked.

Signature words and phrases that recur across posts:
- "Leverage" / "leveraged" / "negative leverage" -- the central concept of the blog
- "Systems" -- as solutions to human problems
- "Signal:noise ratio" -- borrowed from engineering, applied to personal life
- "Exobrain" -- the author's coined term
- "The Four Horsemen of Bad Decisionmaking" -- the author's framework
- "First, do nothing" -- the author's mantra
- "Working smart, not hard" -- recurring theme
- "Consistency over intensity" -- borrowed from Farnam Street
- "I.e." -- used inline as clarification
- "Meaning," -- used as a sentence-starter to draw conclusions

**Register and formality**

The register is informal-with-substance. Contractions are universal. Slang and colloquialisms appear naturally:

> "baller", "colonial gangster", "ravenous reader", "book fiend", "Sneaky Ben", "Suuuuper sketchy", "Boo.", "pain in the ass", "smoother than a baboon's buttcheek"

Profanity is deployed strategically, never gratuitously:

> "Fucking Leveraged" (capitalized for emphasis)
> "Fucking Tough" (same pattern)
> "Fucking Linda from fucking finance"
> "a fuckton of computers"
> "trained with a fuckton of computers"

The author addresses the reader directly with "you" throughout. "We" appears when establishing shared experience. The trademark symbol (TM) is used for humorous invented categories: "Normal Person(TM)", "Normal People(TM)".

Paragraph and Section Structure
-------------------------------

**Paragraph construction**

Paragraphs are short -- overwhelmingly 1-3 sentences. Single-sentence paragraphs are common, used for:
- Emphasis: "This makes _so much sense_."
- Transitions: "It gets crazier: exobrains can upgrade themselves."
- Punchlines: "Some shit, Sherlock."
- Calls to action: "Be Rembrandt."

Multi-paragraph arguments build through a pattern of: claim -> evidence/example -> so-what. The reader is never more than 2-3 paragraphs from either a concrete example or a direct address.

**Section and post structure**

Posts follow a consistent structural template:

1. **Cover image** at the top (generated with ChatGPT)
2. **Series link** if applicable ("This post is part of a series on leverage")
3. **Opening hook** -- personal story, bold claim, or situational setup
4. **Body sections** with h2/h3 headers
5. **"Conclusion" section** with direct questions to the reader
6. **Further Reading** section linking to related posts
7. **Subscribe CTA**
8. **Acknowledgments** (on longer posts): "Thank you to [names] for reviewing drafts of this."

Openings almost always begin with a personal anecdote or observation:

> "I was distracted yesterday and knocked a glass cup off my table."
> "I just finished reading Ben Franklin's autobiography."
> "I was in the gym yesterday when Body Head Bangerz' 'Can't Be Touched' came on"
> "I lost my wallet the other week."
> "Last week I had my first fight with my girlfriend."

Conclusions consistently pose direct questions to the reader, inviting self-reflection:

> "Where are you falling prey to the Four Horsemen of Bad Decisionmaking?"
> "Are you resting enough to maximize your productivity?"
> "What rules or Ulysses pacts can you use to keep you on course?"

Rhetorical Devices and Techniques
----------------------------------

**Argumentation style**

Kevin builds arguments through the pattern: personal experience -> external authority -> principle -> reader application. He leads with story, validates with borrowed authority (Naval, Taleb, Clear Thinking), crystallizes into a named concept, then challenges the reader to apply it.

He anticipates objections inline:

> "The 'first, do nothing' advice seems bad the first time someone hears it."
> "If this sounds too good to be true, it used to be."
> "The common objection is that LLMs make errors, hallucinate. True."

Claims are made boldly, not hedged:

> "I assert it's mastery of ambiguity."
> "Sleep deprivation is poison for every system in your body."
> "I'm beginning to conclude that OpenAI doesn't have the product development skills to make it worth building your exobrain on ChatGPT."

**Figurative language**

Analogies are the dominant rhetorical device, drawn from an unusually wide range of domains:

- Engineering: "You're a bumper car, getting knocked around by the world. The systems you build are guardrails to keep you on track."
- Food: "It's like you wander into the grocery store and grab some chocolate syrup. Then vanilla ice cream. Then some peanuts, why not. Bam -- suddenly, ice cream sundae."
- Art: "I write like I'm painting. Splash stuff down. Refine."
- Games: "It feels like Minecraft, only with results in the real world."
- Military: "Just like a pilot coming in for a bad landing, just pull up and try again later."
- Body: "our mind is like a shaken snowglobe"
- Pop culture: "You know the boss in Office Space, all micromanager-y? B. Franklin was the opposite of that."

**Repetition and emphasis**

Anaphora appears at key moments:

> "I want a fluid stream of idea into constructed output. I want Enso where reality reshapes itself to my flow. I want to speak an idea over morning coffee and have it ready by the time I've finished bacon."

> "So let judgment replace jargon. Storytelling replace stack traces. Taste replace terminals."

Key concepts get restated in different forms across multiple posts, reinforcing the interconnected worldview.

Tone and Emotional Range
------------------------

**Baseline tone**

The default register is earnest curiosity mixed with irreverent humor. Kevin writes like someone genuinely excited about ideas who refuses to be boring about them. The underlying emotional tone is optimistic urgency -- "here's an important thing, and here's how we can do something about it."

Authority is balanced with accessibility through self-deprecation and vulnerability:

> "I'm just an engineer who had a lot of trouble sleeping in his life"
> "I used to think I was a control freak. Which is a rational belief to have, when you're a control freak."
> "I'm an ex-startup founder (CTO) in recovery from burnout"

**Humor**

Humor is observational, absurdist, and self-aware. It serves three functions:

1. **Tension release** after serious content: "Is your mother-in-law driving you nuts? Find a new one."
2. **Making concepts sticky:** "Imagine if computers executed programs like humans. You'd go to open Netflix and sometimes it'd say 'Nah, I'm tired' and other times it'd be sassy and barf the code at you"
3. **Image captions** are almost always jokes, functioning as a humor sidebar: "_Oops... reacted without thinking and now my entire portfolio is Dogecoin._", "_I'm trying to understand you ma'am, but all I hear is 'Never Gonna Give You Up' in the background_", "_Things I Value: treasure. Things I Don't Value: being without treasure._"

**Vulnerability and self-disclosure**

Kevin shares personal struggles matter-of-factly: insomnia, burnout, emotional volatility, relationship conflicts, procrastination cycles. He doesn't dwell or seek sympathy; the disclosure is always in service of a lesson:

> "Stress and sleep deprivation lock me into cycles. I spend the day as a zombie, then at night numb out with Youtube or social media."
> "I've started dating someone I feel good about. There is, however, a risk I lose sight of things that are important to me in the new relationship energy."
> "Last week I had my first fight with my girlfriend."

The vulnerability is calibrated: personal enough to be relatable, but never so raw that it overwhelms the useful content. He treats his own failures as case studies.

**Emotional dynamics**

Posts typically maintain a steady, energetic register with humor peaks and occasional gravity dips. The emotional arc within a post often goes: light/hook -> building seriousness -> core insight -> returning to levity or practical application. The Antje Mattheus harassment story in "First, Do Nothing" is a notable exception where the tone goes genuinely dark before returning.

Author-Reader Relationship
---------------------------

**Implied relationship**

Kevin positions himself as a slightly-ahead peer -- someone who's figured out a few things through painful experience and wants to share the map. Not a guru dispensing wisdom from above; a fellow traveler who's been to the next town and came back with directions.

This is established through:
- Sharing his own failures and ongoing struggles
- Using "you" and "we" interchangeably
- Asking questions rather than issuing commands
- Phrasing advice as "here's what I do" rather than "you should"
- Occasionally flattering the reader as a peer: "A high-performing person like you can handle a lot."

**Engagement techniques**

- Direct questions at section ends and conclusions (the most consistent pattern)
- Rhetorical questions to anticipate reader objections
- Invitations to try exercises: "Get a fresh sheet of paper..." "Try this exercise in your own life..."
- Humor that assumes the reader will get the reference (Ben Franklin + Kindle joke, Office Space, District 9)
- Callout boxes that invite the reader to slow down and do something
- Occasional reverse-psychology humor: "definitely don't subscribe because if you do then I might write more"

**Assumed reader**

The implied reader is ambitious, somewhat technical (or willing to become so), interested in self-improvement, and already consuming content from similar thinkers (Naval, Huberman, etc.). The reader is assumed to be intelligent but potentially on autopilot -- someone who knows better but needs the nudge to actually change behavior.

Structural Patterns
-------------------

**Openings**

Posts almost always open with one of three patterns:

1. **Personal anecdote:** "I was distracted yesterday and knocked a glass cup off my table." / "I lost my wallet the other week." / "Yesterday I followed a link on a Harvard Health article..."
2. **Bold claim:** "I think people miss why the LLM revolution is such a big deal." / "The modern world is Fucking Leveraged."
3. **Contextual setup:** "I just finished reading Ben Franklin's autobiography." / "Unless you live under a rock, your last few years have been a nonstop barrage of 'AI this, AI that'."

**Closings**

Conclusions follow a tight pattern:
1. Brief restatement of the core idea (1-2 sentences)
2. Direct questions to the reader inviting self-reflection (2-4 questions)
3. Link to the next post in the series (if applicable)
4. Subscribe CTA
5. Further Reading links to other posts

> "Take a moment to consider decisionmaking systems for yourself: Where are you trying to go with your life? Where are you falling prey to the Four Horsemen of Bad Decisionmaking? What rules or Ulysses pacts can you use to keep you on course?"

**Use of headers**

Headers are used consistently to break posts into digestible sections. Longer posts may have 5-8 headers. The h1/h2 distinction uses `====` and `----` underlines rather than `#` and `##`.

**Series structure**

Multi-part series are common (Leverage, Exobrain, What's AI Anyway). Each post in a series begins with a link to the series index and a 1-2 sentence recap of the previous post. Series have dedicated index pages with numbered links.

Signature Elements
------------------

**Unique identifiers**

- **Humorous image captions in italics:** Nearly every image has a funny caption that functions as a comedic sidebar. These are one of the most distinctive elements: "_Always just out of reach..._", "_When Goodness is so Powerful you just gotta address it_", "_Not a great gardener_"
- **Emoji-prefixed callout boxes:** Using blockquotes with `> ⚠️`, `> 💡`, `> ℹ️`, `> 🤔`, `> 💭` to classify asides by type
- **Capitalized-for-emphasis phrases:** "Fucking Leveraged", "Really Not Okay", "Danger Fast", "Right Now" -- capitalizing multi-word phrases that aren't proper nouns for vocal emphasis
- **Trademark symbol for humorous categories:** "Normal Person(TM)", "Normal People(TM)"
- **Extended Rap-ese / Formal-ese translations:** Taking informal content and translating it formally (or vice versa) for comic effect, as in the Body Head Bangerz analysis
- **Coined terminology treated as established concepts:** "exobrain", "negative leverage", "Four Horsemen of Bad Decisionmaking", "signal:noise ratio" (applied to personal life)
- **"TODO SUBSCRIBE BUTTON" placeholder:** A distinctive artifact of the writing-in-Markdown workflow visible in source material
- **Cross-post linking as worldbuilding:** Frequent links to other posts create a sense of an expanding, coherent intellectual universe
- **"I.e." and "Meaning," as sentence-starting clarifiers:** Both used to restate or clarify the previous sentence in plainer terms
- **Absurdist metaphors that land:** "smoother than a baboon's buttcheek", "hotter than donuts at a police convention", "more obvious than weed at a Grateful Dead concert"

**Verbal tics and recurring constructions**

- Starting paragraphs with "But" or "And" (very frequent)
- "This is [why/because/how]..." as a transitional construction
- "[Concept] is here." or "[Thing] arrived." as short declarative transitions
- "It's [adjective]. [Explanation]." pattern: "It's dumb easy, and feels like playing a factory videogame."
- Parenthetical humor after a serious statement
- "I [do/did] this because..." to explain personal choices transparently

Voice Replication Checklist
---------------------------
- [ ] Open with a personal story, anecdote, or bold claim -- never with abstract theory or definitions

- [ ] Reference at least one thinker from the pantheon (Naval Ravikant, Nassim Taleb, Charlie Munger, Ben Franklin, Shane Parrish) when relevant
- [ ] Use strategic profanity 1-3 times per post for emphasis -- never gratuitously, and consider capitalizing for extra impact
- [ ] Use italics for emphasis on individual words within sentences, not bold (bold is for defined terms and headers)
- [ ] Add humorous captions in italics below images
- [ ] Use emoji-prefixed callout boxes (`> ⚠️`, `> 💡`, `> ℹ️`) for asides, warnings, and tips
- [ ] End body sections with direct questions to the reader inviting self-reflection
- [ ] Link back to previous posts when referencing concepts you've written about before

- [ ] In how-to/guide posts, share your exact personal setup with specific tools, settings, and configurations
- [ ] Use parenthetical humor after serious or technical statements to keep the tone light
- [ ] When citing a thinker or book, provide enough context that the reader doesn't need to already know them
- [ ] Close with a subscribe CTA, often with a playful or inverted phrasing

Anti-Patterns
-------------
- **Never opens with a definition or abstract statement.** Always starts with a story, observation, or bold claim. Never "In today's world..." or "Let's define X."
- **Never uses corporate or motivational-speaker language.** No "unlock your potential", "synergy", "paradigm shift", or "thought leadership." The closest equivalent would be described in plain language with a concrete example.
- **Never writes in third person.** Always "I" and "you." The rare "we" is for shared human experience, not royal we.
- **Never hedges excessively.** Doesn't pile qualifiers ("it might perhaps be somewhat useful to consider..."). States claims directly, and flags uncertainty explicitly when it exists rather than softening everything.
- **Never uses listicle structure without narrative.** Even posts with heavy list content (Sleep Guide, Chrome tips) wrap lists in narrative context and personal experience. Pure "10 Tips For X" format never appears.
- **Never talks down to the reader.** Explains technical concepts, but frames the explanation as "here's how this works" rather than "let me simplify this for you."
- **Never uses exclamation marks for emphasis in body text.** They appear very rarely, and typically only in quoted speech or callout boxes. Emphasis is achieved through italics, short sentences, and capitalization.
- **Never writes purely abstract posts.** Every post has at least one concrete, personal example grounding the theory.
- **Never moralizes.** The author never says "you should" from a moral standpoint. Recommendations are framed as pragmatic: "this worked for me" or "the evidence suggests." Even the Ben Franklin Virtues discussion frames humility as effective, not morally obligatory.
- **Never uses filler transitions.** No "Without further ado...", "Let's dive in!", "Moving on...", "At the end of the day..." The writing moves between sections via headers or direct statements.
- **Never adds unnecessary qualifiers for politeness.** No "I humbly suggest..." or "If you don't mind my saying..." The tone is direct and assumes the reader wants directness.
- **Never includes stock-photo-style image descriptions.** Image captions are always either humorous or genuinely informative, never generic.
- **Never uses the phrase "in this article" or "in this post" at the opening.** (May reference the post in conclusions or callout boxes, but never as an opener.)
