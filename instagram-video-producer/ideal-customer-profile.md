His problem is he...
--------------------
- Doesn't feel in control of his life
- Doesn't feel like he's fulfilling his potential. Feedback from actual clients:
    - "Feels like I'm stuck, unfulfilled"
    - "Feels like I'm leaving potential on the table"
- Has a strong negative, self-critical voice inside his head because he thinks that's how you succeed
- Doesn't trust himself to make choices aligned with his long-term goals
- Gets caught in traps that aren't serving him:
    - Spending his time on distracting things that aren't aligned with his highest goals
    - Getting stuck in scrolling/internet addictions
    - Getting stuck playing videogames for hours on end
    - Work addiction, as a way to feel useful & valuable without facing the deeper problems
    - Poor sleep habits, creating a vicious cycle of bad sleep → bad decisions → more bad sleep
    - Poor eating habits (especially when paired with other blockers)
    - Drinking & partying
    - Internet, scrolling, social media addictions
    - Videogames
    - Procrastinating on what’s most important for them with what feels fun in the moment
    - Impulsive financial decisions (shopping, trading)
- Feels guilty and ashamed: he feels like he *should* have this figured out, but he doesn't
- Doesn't realize that self-love will help unblock his energy and make him MORE productive

Mindsets leading to his problems
----------------------------------
- He has an internal conceptualization of himself as fundamentally lazy, in need of self-flagellation to be productive
- He believes that the way to accomplish his goals is to apply negative pressure to himself - flog himself into action
- He's strongly self-critical, feeding an intensely negative voice inside his head
- He tends to eschew self-acceptance and positivity, viewing them as floaty and ungrounded from reality
- He doesn't realize that this constant tearing-down of his self-esteem is making his head feel like an unsafe place to be, which is leading to his addictions, which is making everything so much harder
- He doesn't understand the value of being kind to himself: he believes that celebrating his wins and treating himself nicely is going to make him complacent and lazy
- He's terrified he's not good enough and will never be good enough
    - This might be so deep that he doesn't even recognize he has this mindset

Willingness-to-buy
------------------
- He recognizes that what he's doing isn't working
- He's fed up with not getting the results
- He's open to making changes
- He doesn't know how to do what he needs to do
- He's willing to pay 
- He recognizes the value of coaching as leverage: a means to get himself on track

Extra considerations about him
==============================
He usually...
-------------
- Has an ego: he's smart, he knows he's smart, he's ambitious, and he wants to win
- Is suspicious and skeptical of being used or controlled by someone else
- Doesn't trust marketing/sales
- Value logic, reason, and functionality: things that can do things for them and take them places
    - They like tools, frameworks, technology, systems

How to reach him:
-----------------
- Take a servant mentality
    - He's not going to react well to someone trying to show superiority to him or dominate him
- Show him I'm trying to help him win and maximize his potential
    - Show my enthusiasm for helping him meet HIS goals
- Emphasize the acceptance and self-love that he never got and is scared to give himself
- Emphasize that he's not flawed, he's not bad, and there are good reasons for why he doesn't have his problems solved yet
    - For example: the behaviours that are now holding him back were useful in the past
- Emphasize functionality & outcomes
    - Tie any advice I give back to functionality, logic, and science
    - Give him concrete, actionable tools & advice - nothing floaty, too spiritual, or marketing/sales-y
