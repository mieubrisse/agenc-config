Calendar Manager
================
NOTE: to use this, you must follow [the steps to give access to your Google Calendar account](https://github.com/nspady/google-calendar-mcp?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start).

The credentials should be stored in a file in your home directory: `~/.calendar-manager-credentials.json`

🚨 I strongly recommend making this file user-read-only: `chmod 600`
