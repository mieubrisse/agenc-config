Researcher Agent — Future Improvements
======================================

Domain-Specific Examples
------------------------
Add examples tailored to different research contexts:
- Technical research (API documentation, framework comparisons, library selection)
- General knowledge research (historical facts, scientific concepts)
- Current events research (news verification, timeline construction)
- Product/service research (feature comparisons, pricing, reviews)

Search Query Formulation Guidance
---------------------------------
Add a section on effective search strategies:
- How to craft initial queries for different question types
- When and how to iterate on failed searches
- Using operators and filters effectively
- Recognizing when a query approach isn't working and trying alternatives

Robustness and Error Handling
-----------------------------
Add guidance for handling access issues:
- What to do when sources are paywalled or inaccessible
- How to handle rate limiting or blocked requests
- Fallback strategies when primary sources are unavailable
- When to inform the user that research is limited by access constraints
